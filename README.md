# Wavey
A decentralized social network.  For the best explanation of our work, please read [our whitepaper]().  Below is just a summary.

### Context
#### Self-Sovereign Social Networking
With this project, we aim to tackle a handful of the problems that exist as a result of the current social networking landscape.

Among these problems are 
* Repetitive username / password validation
* Repetitive social networking features
* Authentication through centralized services

Blockchains can represent a better solution to user authentication.  By introducing public and private keys for each user in a trust-less, decentralized system, blockchains can introduce *self-sovereign identity*, where each user has full control over their own identity.  

Other services that have realized self-sovereign identity have decoupled the featur of digital identity management from the utility of a service for which one would need a digital identity.  Without such a service, it is undesirable to use such a system.

#### Smart Contract Development
Development of decentralized applications ('Dapp's) has been made simpler via the rise of Ethereum, and by extension, smart contracts.  Smart contracts provide a means to create apps with little infrastructure overhead and large-scale accessibility.  Availability of contracts makes them a viable option for standardization of functionality traditionality taken on by centralized services.

You can read more about smart contracts [here](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html).

### Introduction to Wavey
Wavey is a social network built on the Ethereum blockchain that provides self-sovereign digital identity, and leverages smart contracts to broker peer to peer communication channels between its users.

The wavey system in composed a Etheruem smart contracts, a web client, and libraries for developers to integrate connectivity into their apps.

### Use Cases
Decentralized app, or Dapps, have a sizable barrier to entry.  A developer must first download an Ethereum light clien, or a chrome extension like [Metamask]().  In order to interact with Dapps that they write as well as Dapps that already exist, they will want to understand how gas and fees work.  For a new user, there is a steep learning curve.

Our vision is for Wavey is . . .
